# React Matrix Visualization

## Overview

This is a React application that demonstrates an interactive 10×10 matrix (grid) visualization. Users can click on individual cells to toggle their color between a default light gray and an active blue state. The app showcases React Hooks for state management and component-based architecture.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: A 10×10 grid where each cell can be toggled by clicking.
- **Color Toggling**: Cells change from light gray (default) to blue (active) on click.
- **Responsive Design**: The grid is centered and styled for a clean user experience.
- **React Hooks**: Utilizes `useState` for managing grid state.
- **Component-Based**: Modular design with a dedicated `Grid` component.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the grid and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript features including arrow functions and destructuring.
